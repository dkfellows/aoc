# Advent of Code 2025... in Tcl!
This is the code I'm writing as part of the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

This mostly requires (at least) Tcl 9.0; the `lseq` command is just too useful for these kinds of little problems. I'm so glad we added it, or I'd have needed to invent it for these.
