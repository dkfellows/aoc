# Advent of Code 2025... in Tcl!
This is the code I'm writing as part of the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025). I'm trying to do it all in pure Tcl, no external libraries or service calls; I'm interested in the algorithmics more than the leaderboards.

This mostly requires (at least) [Tcl 9.0 (source over here)](https://github.com/tcltk/tcl/releases/tag/core-9-0-3); the `lseq` command is just too useful for these kinds of little problems. I'm so glad we added it, or I'd have needed to invent it for these.

## Other years
There are no previous years. I don't know if I'll ever bother to attempt them.

# External contributions
I will not accept outside contributions (so don't ask!), but might read others' code. If I do, I'll cite you. I may also cite other useful links.
