Note that _all_ solutions today require Tcl 9.
## Code
* [`day10-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; simple XOR combination](day10-part1.tcl)
* [`day10-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; linear equation solving](day10-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data from the first part](day10-example.txt)
* [the actual circuit definitions to process](day10.txt)

The solution to part 2 is _strongly_ derived from [this awesome and horrifying code by RussellDash332](https://github.com/RussellDash332/advent-of-code/blob/main/aoc-2025%2FDay-10%2FPython%2Fmain.py). It is fast, effective, and ugly... Tip of the hat to you, sir!
