# **Christmas Tree Farm** _aka_ **The Trees! NOT THE TREES!** 
It's a bit of a gift this one! In general, the problem is terribly difficult, but the actual problems aren't.
## Code
* [`day12-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; a very basic sanity check](day12-part1.tcl)
* There is no Zuul. Or rather this one is passed by officially passing every other puzzle; no _direct_ code required.
## Data
* [the example data, in case you're mad enough to try it](day12-example.txt)
* [the actual presents and trees to process](day12.txt)
