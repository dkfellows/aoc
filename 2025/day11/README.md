# **Reactor** _aka_ **The Computer Devices**
Ah yes, graph theory. Easy!
Note that _all_ solutions today require Tcl 9.
## Code
* [`day11-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; small subgraph](day11-part1.tcl)
* [`day11-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; sections of big graph](day11-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data from the first part](day11-example.txt)
* [the sample data from the second part](day11-example2.txt)
* [the actual device graph to process](day11.txt)
