# **Laboratories** _aka_ **The Tachyon Splitters**
The obvious one-pass algorithm turns out to be exceptionally efficient (depth first searching is _terrible_ for this).

Note that _all_ solutions today require Tcl 9.
## Code
* [`day7-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; count the splits](day7-part1.tcl)
* [`day7-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; count the paths in each column](day7-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data from the first part](day7-example.txt)
* [the actual manifold to process](day7.txt)
