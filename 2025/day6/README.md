# **Trash Compactor** _aka_ **The Cephalopod Worksheet**
Note that _all_ solutions today require Tcl 9.
This is an exercise in parsing data in awkward shapes; it reminds me a lot of working with older scientific datasets...
## Code
* [`day6-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; words in columns](day6-part1.tcl)
* [`day6-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; columnar words!](day6-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data from the first part](day6-example.txt)
* [the actual worksheet to process](day6.txt)
