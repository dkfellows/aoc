# **Cafeteria** _aka_ **The Cafeteria Product IDs**
These solutions require Tcl 8.6 or later; no Tcl 9.0 features were required.
TclOO was used to make _range_ objects, which simplify things quite a bit.
## Code
* [`day5-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; range membership testing](day5-part1.tcl)
* [`day5-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; range merging and counting](day5-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data](day5-example.txt)
* [the actual product ID descriptions](day5.txt)
