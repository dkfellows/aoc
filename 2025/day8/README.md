# **Playground** _aka_ **The Christmas Lights**
If you've done one Union-Find, you've done them all. (This is the first of the _harder_ problems.)

Note that _all_ solutions today require Tcl 9.
## Code
* [`day8-part1.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the first part; fixed prefix](day8-part1.tcl)
* [`day8-part2.tcl` &mdash; The solution to the second part; final coords of complete](day8-part2.tcl)
## Data
* [the sample data from the first part](day8-example.txt)
* [the actual coordinates to process](day8.txt)
